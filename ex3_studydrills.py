# Study Drills

# Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
# Remember in Exercise 0 when you started Python? Start Python this way again and using the above characters and what you know, use Python as a calculator.
# Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.
# Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. Find out why by researching what a "floating point" number is.
# Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate (hint: 20.0 is floating point).

print "I will now count my chickens:"
# Giving values to "Hens" and "Roosters"
print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

print "Now I will count the eggs:"
# Giving python the calculations for "eggs"
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7

print "Oh, that's why it's False."

print "How about some more."

print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2

# This exercise is basically showing you the math capabilities within python.
