# Study Drills

# If you aren't really sure what return does, try writing a few of your own functions 
# and have them return some values. You can return anything that you can put to the right 
# of an =.
# At the end of the script is a puzzle. I'm taking the return value of one function and using 
# it as the argument of another function. I'm doing this in a chain so that I'm kind of creating
# a formula using the functions. It looks really weird, but if you run the script you can see the 
# results. What you should do is try to figure out the normal formula that would recreate this same set of operations.
# Once you have the formula worked out for the puzzle, get in there and see what happens when 
# you modify the parts of the functions. Try to change it on purpose to make another value.
# Finally, do the inverse. Write out a simple formula and use the functions in the same way
# to calculate it.
# This exercise might really whack your brain out, but take it slow and easy and treat 
# it like a little game. Figuring out puzzles like this is what makes programming 
# fun, so I'll be giving you more little problems like this as we go.

# If we take (50/2), which is 25, then feed 180 * 25, then feed -4500 from 74 (or 74 -4500) gives us -4426 and then adds 35 to it, giving us -4391 as the final answer

print "That becomes: ", what, "Can you do it by hand?"
