#Study Drills

#You will also have Study Drills. The Study Drills contain things you should try to do. If you can't, skip it and come back later.

#For this exercise, try these things:

#Make your script print another line.
#Make your script print only one of the lines.
#Put a '#' (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.

print "Hello World!" #(The # Character omits the line from the code and treats it as a "note")
print "Hello Again"
print "I like typing this."
print "This is fun."
print 'Yay! Printing.'
print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
print ' I "said" do not touch this.'
print "Making my script print another line"

# to print only one line us the "#" to omit the line.
