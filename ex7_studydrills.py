# Study Drills

# For these next few exercises, you will have the exact same Study Drills.

# Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
# Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
# From now on, when you make mistakes write down on a piece of paper what 
# kind of mistake you made.
# When you go to the next exercise, look at the last mistakes you made
# and try not to make them in this new one.
# Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians
# who like everyone to think they are perfect and never wrong, but 
# it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.

# Lines 16 - 20 print "Mary had a little lamb" but in line 17 the "%s" is used to insert "snow"
# and in line 20 we are saying print the '.' ten times.
print "Mary had a little lamb." 
print "it's fleece was white as %s." % 'snow'
print "And everywhere that Mary went."
print "." * 10 
# Lines 22 - 33 are defining variables. end1 - end 12 when combined spell 
# "cheeseburger"
end1 = "c"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "b"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# Lines 37 - 38 print end1 - end12 by adding them all together.
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
