# Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).
# Take your ex2.py file and review each line going backward. Start at the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.
# Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
# Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python. 

print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# print "This won't run."

print "This will run."
